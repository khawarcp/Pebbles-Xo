I think “treat” might be a better way to discuss the work and also prevention. There are 4 exercises- what I call the Foundational Four. Each one has specific benefits for common foot problems. What I have discovered and strongly believe is that most foot problems stem from a weak arch that results in a mis-aligned skeletal anatomy. A strong foot is a healthy foot. People will be searching for help with plantar fasciitis, bunions, arch support, and neuropathy.<\/p><ul><li>The Plantar Foot and Calf stretch- great for plantar fasciitis, runners and calf cramps <\/li><li>The 51’s- great for balance training, neuropathy, and morton’s neuroma<\/li><li> The Arch-Pop great for fallen arches, flat feet, bunions, and weight training<\/li><li> The Gait Keeper- great for running, posture and hip & knee pain<\/li><\/ul>",
